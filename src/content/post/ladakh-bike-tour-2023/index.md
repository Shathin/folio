## What Actually Happened! 🚀

## ✈️ Day 1 - Friday, May 26, 2023 : BLR ➡️ DEL & Sightseeing

Everything went as planned! ✅ We boarded our early morning flights from Bengaluru at 05:00 and arrived in Delhi at approximately 09:00. . 🛫🌇 After collecting our bags, we took some time to relax and then made our way to the **Birla Mandir** where our tour bus was waiting, which we had booked in advance. We needed to occupy ourselves until around 18:00, when it was time to catch our bus to Manali. The Tour Bus also served as a convenient place to store our luggage! 😂

Our first stop was India Gate. While it was a serene place, I personally felt that the beauty was overshadowed by the excessive number of individuals offering ear cleaning services with Q-Tips. I understand they have to make a living, but the aggressive solicitation to clean someone's ears really detracted from the tourism experience.

Continuing our journey, we passed by the government housing for various top ministers and MLAs near the **Parliament** on our way to **Qutub Minar**. Before visiting Qutub Minar, we briefly stopped at a textile shop, although none of us entered it. Instead, we went to a small shop, what we call a "**Pettige Angadi**" in Kannada, and spent more than ₹1,500 on food and beverages! 😂🍔🍻 After this, we explored Qutub Minar and took some photos.

Next on our itinerary was the **Lotus Temple**. We admired it from a distance and didn't have enough time to go inside due to the large crowd. We then proceeded to **Raj Ghat**, where we decided to leave the rest of the tour bus journey since it was almost time to catch our bus to Manali 🚌. After freshening up, we unloaded our luggage, booked a cab, and headed to the bus pickup point.

Along our journey, we encountered some unfortunate news that disrupted our plans. It seemed that members of the Leh Bike Union had caused trouble by vandalizing vehicles traveling from Manali to Ladakh. As a result, bikes from Manali and other regions were not permitted to enter Ladakh. Surprisingly, the Manali Bike Union had also implemented a similar restriction. This unexpected development forced us to adjust our itinerary, shifting the starting and ending points of our bike circuit from Manali to Leh. To accommodate the change, we would be traveling in a TT (Tempo Traveller) between Manali and Leh. Although it was an unexpected twist, we remained optimistic and ready to embrace the new adventure ahead.

| Distance Travelled       | 2,029 km                                           |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Flight** ✈️ BLR ➡️ DEL | ~1,700 km                                          |
| **Cab** 🚕               | ~22 km                                             |

### 😎 Day 2 - Saturday, May 27, 2023 : Arrive @ Manali & Chill 😎

We arrived at [**Brotherhood Resort**](https://goo.gl/maps/rzSFmTxkcYbh3yd66) around 08:15 in the morning, settled into our rooms, freshened up, and enjoyed a satisfying breakfast. Shortly after, we received a call from our guide, [**Pankaj**](https://www.instagram.com/pankaj.sharma_7/) of [**Gorkha Expedition**](https://www.instagram.com/gorkha_expedition/) and [**Tsewang**](https://www.instagram.com/tsewang_namgail_ladakh/), informing us of a delay caused by bad weather. He would be joining us after lunchtime. In the meantime, we gathered together in one of the rooms, spending time chatting and relaxing until lunch was served. After a leisurely meal, we continued to unwind and enjoy the laid-back atmosphere. 😴

When Pankaj finally arrived at the hotel, he shared the challenging ordeal he had faced due to the extreme weather conditions at Baralacha-La (pass). He had been stuck there for over 20 hours without food or water. He also informed us that our planned itinerary might need to be adjusted since Baralacha-La had been closed for traffic by the Border Roads Organization (BRO). Our plan to take an extended route via Jammu and Srinagar was also no longer viable since that route was closed due to bad weather as well. Consequently, we made the decision to wait for a day in Manali, hoping for improved weather conditions at Baralacha-La. We all agreed to this change and continued to relax. During this time, Pankaj briefed us on what to expect during our road trip to Leh.

In the evening, we ventured out to explore the lively Manali Market, indulging in some local delicacies and taking in the sights. With an extra day added to our stay in Manali, we decided to make the most of it by enjoying a peaceful evening and getting a good night's rest. 😴 We couldn't help but notice the unique energy and charm of the cab drivers in Manali, which added a touch of humor to our experience. 😂

### 🚗 Day 3 - **Sun, May 28, 2023 : Sightseeing @ Manali**

With an extra day in Manali, we arranged for a vehicle to take us on a sightseeing adventure around the area. 🚗 We first visited **Naggar Fort** and then made our way to the nearby Nicholas Roerich Art Gallery. 🏰🖼️ We took our time, enjoyed the surroundings, had a delicious lunch, and captured memorable photos at both locations. 📸

Some of our adventurous companions decided to embark on an exciting river rafting experience, while the rest of us found a serene spot under the shade of trees to relax and unwind. Later, we made our way to **Vaishno Devi Temple** in Kullu. It felt amusingly unique as the temple was nestled within a complex, quite different from the temples we are accustomed to in the south! 😂🌳🏞️

As the day progressed, we decided to add a touch of adrenaline to our memories and try paragliding. However, our plans were thwarted when we learned that it had been temporarily closed due to inclement weather while we were en route to the peak. Disappointed but undeterred, we returned to our accommodation to chill. 😌

Back at our stay, we received exciting news that one-way traffic was now permitted through Baralacha-La. With this development, we collectively agreed to head towards **Jispa** the following day, a picturesque destination just a few kilometers before the Darcha checkpost. 🛣️🏔️

### 🚌 Day 4 - **Mon, May 29, 2023 : Manali ➡️ Jispa**

We woke up, freshened up, packed our bags, had breakfast, and embarked on our journey towards Jispa in a Tempo Traveller (TT) since Manali bikes were not permitted in Ladakh. The road was exceptional throughout, with hardly any potholes or rough stretches! 🛣️

Since the Rohtang Pass was closed, we took the route through the Atal Tunnel. Let me tell you, going through that tunnel made us think, "This is truly an engineering marvel!" The tunnel stretches a little over 9km with minimal curves and holds the title of the World's Longest Highway Tunnel. The entrance and exits, aptly named "portals," made us feel like we had been teleported to a different place upon exiting the tunnel! 🚇

We captured some stunning photos, enjoyed soup, coffee, and snacks from the local vendors before continuing our journey towards Jispa. It was fascinating to observe that none of the vendors littered their cups, plates, or other disposables. Supposedly, the government strictly enforces regulations requiring vendors to carry bags for collecting waste. This practice contributed to keeping the area (mostly) clean. ♻️

During our journey, we made a stop at a roadside shop for some Maggi noodles and tea. We also took the opportunity to fly the drone, capturing breathtaking footage. Every inch of the surroundings was picturesque, making it impossible not to set it as your wallpaper! 📸🌄

We proceeded towards the Darcha Checkpost, hoping for a chance to pass through and reach Baralacha-La (pass). Unfortunately, the police at the check post directed us to turn back. Disappointed but undeterred, we made our way to our accommodation in Jispa - [**IBEX Camps**](https://goo.gl/maps/MjGSKRVgBSsYyNJM7).

We had five cozy tents awaiting us, furnished with warm beds and blankets. We ordered food, snapped photos, shared laughter, and even danced during the night! Dancing here proved to be quite tiring; just a few steps left us breathless. The difference in oxygen levels compared to our homes in the south was evident. Thankfully, our enjoyment was the only thing that escalated, and nobody suffered from Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) or any other illness due to our shenanigans. 😄💃

With high hopes for the next day, we all retired to bed. 🤞🏽

### 🚌 Day 5 - **Tue, May 30, 2023 : Jispa ➡️ Dharmashala**

After completing our usual morning routines, we geared up to head towards Sarchu via Baralacha-La. However, we received news that a significant amount of traffic had already accumulated, causing a delay in moving forward. Determined to make progress, we hurriedly made our way to the Darcha check post, hoping to join the queue of vehicles waiting to proceed. We patiently waited for over 1-2 hours alongside many others, but our hopes were dashed when we learned from the Border Roads Organization (BRO) officials at the check post that heavy snowfall had occurred overnight and throughout the morning at Baralacha-La. Consequently, they had to halt traffic for the day and send everyone back. 😔❄️

Given the unfavorable weather forecast and the situation at Baralacha-La, we found ourselves with only two options: either wait indefinitely or take the longer route to Leh via Dharamshala → Jammu → Srinagar → Leh, which would require three days including the current day. Despite our disappointment, we unanimously decided to embark on the longer route, thus commencing the unplanned segment of our journey. Our guide, Pankaj, and Tsewang accompanied us in a separate vehicle as they too needed to reach Leh. 🚗🏔️

During the journey, we encountered a massive traffic jam near Mandi due to ongoing road widening work that involved controlled explosions. This further delayed our progress. ⏳

We finally reached Dharamshala close to midnight, only to be greeted by inclement weather with heavy rain. Adding to our predicament, our TT vehicle was running low on fuel, and the petrol stations refused to provide fuel due to the power outage. Moreover, the road leading to our accommodation — [**Hotel King’s Castle**](https://goo.gl/maps/sGhTMnExQ2UubfYz5), situated atop a hill, proved to be an adventure in itself, with its narrow and steep terrain. We must give immense credit to Ricky, our skilled TT driver, who maneuvered us up the challenging road like a true professional! 🔥

Exhausted but relieved, we settled in for the night, making plans to continue our journey towards Srinagar the next day, while fervently hoping for improved weather conditions. 🛏️🌧️🤞🏽

### 🚌 Day 6 - **Wed, May 31, 2023 : Dharmashala ➡️ Srinagar**

After completing our usual morning routine, we boarded the TT and set off towards Srinagar. We stopped for lunch somewhere after Pathankot and joined the longest highway in India, NH44.

However, along the way, we received more unfortunate news! 😞 Pankaj informed us about a landslide on NH44, which led the J&K Police to halt traffic movement towards Srinagar. We were disheartened by this news, thinking that we might have to spend an extra day in a hotel before proceeding. Luckily, we came across a tweet from the J&K Police stating that the landslide had been cleared and traffic movement had resumed. Though the weather remained a bit unfavorable, with signs of heavy rain later at dawn, we decided to take a risk and continue towards Srinagar, hoping to avoid any further landslides along the way. 🤞🏽

The initial stretch of NH44 until our dinner stop was amazing, with wide roads and hardly any potholes. However, after that, our nightmare began! 💀 As expected, the weather started deteriorating, and it began to drizzle. The road ahead was under construction, comprising narrow paths and off-road sections with muddy hills prone to landslides on one side. Soon after passing through this section, we encountered a traffic jam, witnessing mud slowly sliding out of place. At one point, even some mud splashed onto our vehicle, making for a slightly scary experience! Thankfully, a police vehicle was trailing us, enabling us to swiftly maneuver out of the area. The subsequent stretch was equally challenging, as we traveled along cliffside roads with minimal guardrails, numerous oncoming trucks, and below average road conditions. The darkness engulfed us, with inadequate lighting, and a sheer drop on the left side into a river (Chenab River Tributary) flowing alongside. It was undeniably an adventurous ride!

As luck would have it, another setback occurred on our journey, this time with the TT itself. It lost power and came to a halt, leaving us stranded on a cliff with no way to proceed. After approximately 30-45 minutes, Ricky, our driver, managed to identify the issue and get the vehicle running again!

We made a stop at a small Pettige Angadi to enjoy some ☕️ while Ricky took a brief smoke break. During our conversation with the shop owner, we discovered that the shop remained open 24/7, with the father working the night shift and the son taking over the midnight-day shift. It made me deeply grateful for the comforts of my own life, where I don't have to work tirelessly like them to make a living!

After a long and eventful drive, we finally arrived in Srinagar, sometime in the early hours before dawn.

### 🚌 Day 7 - **Thu, Jun 01, 2023 : Srinagar ➡️ Leh, Ladakh**

In Srinagar, we received news that traffic on Zoji-La (pass) was restricted to one direction at a time. We had to leave immediately, or else we would be stuck at the check post until evening. With just an hour of rest, Ricky, our driver, started the drive towards Zoji-La. Fortunately, we encountered no problems and crossed it on time! Finally, we had entered Ladakh! 🎉

Thoughts on Zoji-La — There were remnants of snow on the curbs in many places, reminding us of the recent snowfall. Yet, thankfully, the road itself was clear. Seeing the roads here fills you with gratitude for those who built them on such treacherous terrain. "Zoji" stands for "Blizzard," and "La" for "Pass" — the Pass of Blizzards. We learned at the Kargil War Memorial that during the Kargil War, the Thambis (Engineering Corps of the Army) successfully maneuvered a tank through this challenging terrain when there were no roads. Their accomplishment played a vital role in recapturing Zoji-La (pass) from the Pakistani Army. A huge salute to the Army and the BRO (Border Roads Organisation) for constructing such remarkable roads! 🫡

We made a stop at the Zero Point on the pass summit, where we rode snowmobiles and took some photos! It was thrilling to ride a snowmobile! ❄️ Moreover, it was my first time touching snow!

Afterward, we headed towards Drass, the world's second coldest town during winter, where temperatures plummet to -40°C. Luckily, it wasn't that extreme during our visit 😛. We had our breakfast there and then proceeded towards Kargil.

Visiting the Kargil War Memorial wasn't initially planned, but we were glad we did. It had been on our bucket lists. Stepping into the memorial and reading about the courageous efforts of our soldiers filled us with immense pride for them and our nation. However, it also brought sadness to see the countless lives sacrificed for the country. A tremendous salute to the soldiers who fought tirelessly in the unforgiving and treacherous mountains around Kargil! 🫡 🇮🇳

Finally, we headed towards our ultimate destination - Leh! We arrived at our stay in Leh — [\*\*Khamba Villa](https://goo.gl/maps/Qd4TPiRNaL84FGME8)\*\* during the night, unpacked, had dinner, and relaxed.

Considering our streak of bad luck, we had a few decisions to make before settling in for the night:

1. Should we extend the duration of the trip to cover (almost) all the planned places? This would require applying for extra leave and incurring additional costs.
2. Should we omit certain places to complete as much as possible within our current timeframe?
3. Should we risk returning to Manali via Baralacha-La and then traveling to Delhi to catch our flights, or should we book a flight from Leh?

After discussing for some time, we unanimously decided to book a flight from Leh to Bengaluru. This choice allowed us to cover (almost) all the planned places without extending the duration of the trip while avoiding having to go through Baralacha-La (pass).

With everything decided and our hopes reignited, we settled in for the night! 😴

### **🏍️** Day 8 - **Fri, Jun 02, 2023 : Sightseeing @ Leh 🏍️**

After completing our usual morning routines, we gathered together with our bikes and welcomed new members who would be joining us on our journey. We had [**Padma**](https://www.instagram.com/thinlay_bai_999/), our marshal and the owner of the bikes, [**Twesang Chostar (a.k.a Chopa)**](https://www.instagram.com/tsewangchostar)—our guide (different from the Twesang mentioned before), and [**Sachin**](https://www.instagram.com/banotra_sabb_408/)—our marshal and mechanic.

With everyone prepared and filled with excitement, we geared up, loaded our luggage onto the camper (our backup vehicle), filled our tanks, and headed towards the check post before the mighty Khardung-La. To our surprise, bad luck struck once again as we received news that heavy snowfall had occurred in Khardung-La, and no bikes or 4-wheelers without snow chains would be allowed to pass.

Feeling disheartened, we decided to make the most of our time and explore the sights around Leh, an activity we had originally planned for the end of our trip, considering our streak of bad luck. However, we still managed to enjoy the ride around Leh.

Our first stop was the Hemis Monastery, where **Chopa** gave us a guided tour, sharing interesting information about the items displayed in the monastery's museum. He was so knowledgeable about the place that other tourists were trying to steal him from us! 😂 We also spent some time browsing the Souvenir Shop in the monastery and bought plenty of items for our family members and ourselves. After that, we explored more of the monastery before moving on to our next destination. We surprised Chopa, as he didn't expect us to spend nearly 3 hours in one place! 😂 The weather slightly worsened as we left, and we had to put on our rain gear, but fortunately, it quickly improved.

Next, we visited the Rancho school, named after Aamir Khan's character in the movie "3 Idiots." We took some photos, shared a few laughs, and then continued on our way. Before returning to our stay, we had a pre-dinner meal.

Back at our accommodation, we once again faced a decision regarding Khardung-La for the next day. _What if it doesn't open tomorrow?_ After discussing our options, we concluded that the best course of action would be to reverse our itinerary and head towards Tso Moriri first, instead of Nubra Valley!

With this plan in mind, we all settled in for the night, ready for the adventures that awaited us. 😴

### **🏍️** Day 9 - **Sat, Jun 03, 2023 : Leh ➡️ Tso Moriri 🏍️**

We woke up to slightly worsened weather near our stay and received news from our guide that the road to Khardung-La was still closed. We decided to wait at the stay, hoping for better weather and the snow in the pass to melt. However, when we reached the check post, we learned that the chances of Khardung-La opening were quite low. To avoid wasting additional days, we made the decision to reverse our itinerary and head towards Tso Moriri instead. And so, our bike tour began! 🏍️

By the time everything was settled, it was already noon, and we had a 200 km ride ahead of us. The roads were incredible and scenic, so we rode at a slightly faster pace. We took a brief lunch break at Upshi and continued towards the Mahe Bridge, where a check post required us to show our permits to enter Tso Moriri. A few kilometers of road around the Mahe Bridge were off-road, but otherwise, the curvy roads were in good condition! We took a small break at the check post, enjoyed some tea, and then headed towards Tso Moriri. Tso Moriri was approximately 50 km from the check post, and while the roads were good for a short distance, a large portion of the road to Tso Moriri was off-road with some inclines and hair pin curves. It was an enjoyable ride nonetheless!

First, we encountered a mini-version of Tso Moriri called Kyagar Tso. It was a peaceful and scenic place. After a few more kilometers of off-road riding and a very tiny water crossing, we finally arrived at our stay in Tso Moriri — [**Tsomoriri Camp and Resort**](https://goo.gl/maps/RvBpYNnqQCt6XePg7) when it was almost dark, around 19:00 in the evening.

Although we couldn't fully enjoy the view at Tso Moriri due to our late arrival, we were treated to a breathtaking sight when the moon emerged over the lake. It was the day before the full moon, and the moon shone brightly, turning the entire scene into a picturesque painting.

The first day of the bike tour turned out to be a blast! We experienced amazing tarmac roads and off-road sections where we maintained a decent speed. It was my first time riding off-road for such a long distance, and it was so much fun! We cruised at 40-60 km/h on these muddy roads, and the suspensions on the Himalayan bike were absolutely fantastic; both the riders and passengers hardly felt any bumps. And so, as the day came to an end, we had our dinner and settled in for the night.

### **🏍️** Day 10 - **Sun, Jun 04, 2023 : Tso Moriri ➡️ Hanle 🏍️**

We woke up the next day, and it really hit us then—the cold and the lack of oxygen at such altitudes. Even wearing our riding gear was exhausting; we found ourselves panting for breath after doing even the simplest tasks, things we consider insignificant back down south. After gearing up, packing our bags, and having breakfast, we decided to ride closer to the lake before setting off, and so we did. We took some pictures and then headed towards Hanle.

To reach Hanle, we had to go back to the Mahe Bridge, so it meant riding through yesterday's off-road stretch again 😂 Initially, I wasn't keen on going through the same route again, but once we started riding, I found myself enjoying it once more. We reached the Mahe Bridge, took a break, and then continued towards Hanle. Along the way, we encountered numerous military encampments, buildings, and convoys, and we saluted them as we passed by. The road after the Mahe checkpost, following a bit of off-road stretch, was absolutely amazing! 🤩 The quality of the tarmac was exceptional, making the ride so much fun and exciting!

At Nyoma, we even met a soldier from Karnataka and had a conversation with him, asking about his experience in Ladakh. He mentioned that it was slightly challenging due to the altitude and the food. It made us realize that the things we often take for granted are considered luxuries by our protectors. We were also approached by another army officer who asked for our involvement in shooting a small video to raise awareness about the rise of plastic user in Ladakh. We were more than happy to oblige! After that, we continued our journey towards Hanle. The road was mostly good, with some light off-road sections, but the surrounding terrain was unlike anything we had seen so far. It resembled more of a desert with high sand dunes than the snow-capped mountains, yet it was still breathtakingly stunning. It felt like being surrounded by an amazing 360-degree wallpaper.

After yet another pleasant and enjoyable ride, we reached Hanle. We took a break at the entrance to have some light food before heading to our accommodation. Here, we faced yet another decision—should we go to Umling-La and sacrifice Turtuk, or should we go to Turtuk and sacrifice Umling-La? Even though we had one buffer day at the end of our trip, we had to make this choice due to the uncertain status of Khardung-La. Considering our luck, there was a high chance it would be closed on the day we were supposed to pass through, which would require us to ride all the way back on the same route, taking two additional days. All of us had a strong desire to visit Umling-La, as it is the highest motorable pass in the world and was at the top of our bucket lists. Therefore, we made the decision to drop Turtuk for this trip and hoped to return to Ladakh another time to explore it! 🤞

After our break, we headed to our accommodations, relaxed, and had dinner. The host at [**Gua Homestay**](https://goo.gl/maps/RGNDEY5jWAbwC2S66) even played a small piece for us on a native string instrument (I can't recall the name at the moment). We had a conversation for some time, and then our guide Chopa informed us that the village had a telescope provided by the government, which we could use to observe the night sky. We all climbed onto the camper (pickup truck), some sitting inside while others stood behind. The fact that it was close to 0 degrees at night didn't make it any easier 😂 but we had fun. We looked at some stars that the telescope owner aligned for us. Hanle was a remote village away from light pollution place and hence famous for stargazing, but a small disappointment for all of us was that the day we arrived in Hanle happened to be a full moon day and wasn't as ideal for stargazing due to the bright moon. Nevertheless, even with the moon's brightness, we were still able to see many stars. It made us wonder how much light pollution exists in cities where, even on a no moon day, we can barely spot a single star.

With our "stargazing" session complete, we all headed back and tucked ourselves in, ready for the next adventure—Umling-La! 🔥

### **🏍️** Day 11 - **Mon, Jun 05, 2023 : Hanle ↔️ Umling-La ➡️ Nyoma**

We all woke up the next day, filled with excitement as we were heading towards Umling-La. After having our breakfast, we hopped on our bikes and hit the road! 🚀

The initial stretch of road, at least a few kilometers, was pure off-road. We found ourselves riding through a desert-like terrain with no proper road, just heading in a general direction! There were a few sandy patches that made maneuvering a bit challenging, but overall it was fine. As we approached the Chisumle-Demchok road, about 1-2 kilometers before reaching it, it suddenly started snowing. We got slightly worried as this could mean a difficult return journey. The road remained off-road until we reached the Chisumle-Demchok road, after which it turned into smooth tarmac. The ride all the way to Umling-La was simply amazing. As we got closer to the peak, we could feel our bikes struggling in certain stretches of the road. Even in mildly inclined sections, the bikes were having difficulty throttling in 2nd gear. However, one thing we noticed was that the distribution of oxygen seemed uneven because the same bike, a bit further ahead, was performing normally and able to go faster in 3rd gear on steeper roads. Finally, we reached the top, and the feeling was absolutely wonderful! 🔥 We were on top of the world's highest motorable pass, Umling-La, at 5,798 meters or 19,024 feet! We were advised not to stay for too long due to the risk of altitude sickness, but unintentionally, we ended up staying a bit longer, clicking photos and enjoying the moment 😂 For most of us, this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and the rest of us could only hope to return here later in life, perhaps with our own bikes.

Being on the road towards Demchok, the village near China, one thought that crossed our minds while at the top was about the soldiers who stand guard in such treacherous situations and terrains. Our hearts and respect go out to all those brave soldiers, including those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to protect us! A big salute to the soldiers! 🫡

After a Chai ☕️ break, we made our way back to Hanle, following the same road we came from. As always, the ride was exhilarating! 🔥

Upon reaching Hanle, we headed towards the Hanle Observatory, a small remote-controlled observatory. Since there was no one available to guide us, we opened the PPTs (PowerPoint presentations) ourselves, took a look around, and moved on. We stopped at an army-run cafe in Hanle for lunch, and the food was absolutely amazing! We all felt a bit tired during our time there, unsure if it was the effects of AMS (Acute Mountain Sickness) from Umling-La or simply fatigue.

After a long break, we continued our journey towards Nyoma since we didn't have accommodation booked in Hanle due to our reversed itinerary. Along the way, one of our bikes ran out of fuel. Luckily, our mechanic had kept a spare pipe in one of our vehicles, and with some assistance from the mechanic, we managed to refuel the bike enough to reach Nyoma.

Chopa arranged accommodation for us at his cousin's place — [**Stanzin Homestay**](https://goo.gl/maps/LQxCA59S6Ywg74it8), in Nyoma since there were no available hotels for us. This gesture made us all very happy! He prepared regular milk chai, Kava, and even Butter Tea for us to try. He also fried some chips and made pasta for our dinner. We spent some time chatting before calling it a night, closing another adventure-filled day and crossing off an item from our bucket lists. ✨

### **🏍️** Day 12 - **Tue, Jun 06, 2023 : Nyoma ➡️ Kaksang-La ➡️ Pangong Tso**

We woke up after a refreshing night's sleep and were greeted by a beautiful snowfall! ❄️ Chopa informed us that we needed to wait for the snow to stop before continuing, so we enjoyed breakfast and prepared for the day's journey.

Chopa made some calls and discovered a different, shorter route to Pangong Tso from Nyoma, taking a diversion at Mahe. Little did we know, this diversion would lead us to a new adventure. 😂 This route took us through two passes we had never heard of before, Kaksang-La and Thato-La. Starting from Nyoma, we headed towards the Mahe diversion. Along the way, our guides approached a vehicle coming from the opposite direction to inquire about the road conditions. They informed us that the roads were in great condition, but it was snowing ahead. With caution in mind, we continued our journey. The roads were remarkable, with few potholes or irregularities. The snowfall intensified as we ascended. Nevertheless, we pressed on! Before reaching the peak, I stopped a vehicle heading the opposite way to ask about the conditions ahead. The driver advised us to maintain speed or risk getting stuck in the snow. At this point, we genuinely felt a sense of trepidation, but we kept moving forward.

The weather conditions worsened as we reached the peak, and we found ourselves and the road fully covered in snow, with only a glimpse of the tarmac visible. This was my first time riding on snow, and even a slight throttle caused the vehicle to slide out of control. I had to reduce the throttle to maintain traction on the road. Although I had a good helmet equipped with an anti-fog pin lock, I couldn't keep my visor closed due to wearing spectacles, causing fogging issues. To make matters worse, the anti-fog layer on the inside of the visor also fogged up. Up until the peak, I kept my visor half open to prevent fogging on my spectacles and to avoid snow obstructing my view. When we briefly stopped at the peak, I fully opened my visor, but upon attempting to close it partially as before, I discovered a layer of ice had formed on the inside, and was impossible to clear. I had to keep the visor fully open and continue riding, fortunately, my spectacles remained free from fog or ice during that time. From this point on, it became a true adventure, with stretches of road covered three-quarters in snow, and only a narrow tarmac section near the cliff side available for driving. We drove slowly but steadily, and at one point, we stumbled upon a small cafe situated somewhere between Kalsang-La and Thato-La. We stopped to inquire about the road conditions, and they attempted to sell us some Chai 😂 On any other day, we would have gladly indulged, but not that day 😂 The only thought on our minds was that it must not turn into a rescue operation 😂 as there were no vehicles ahead or behind us, so no one would know of our presence. Therefore, we kept moving. Luckily, a little after the peak, the snow on the roads disappeared, making driving a bit easier. The snowfall also subsided, providing a momentary sense of relief. However, we didn't stop and continued until we reached Chushul. Even upon reaching, we sought a safe spot to halt, eventually finding an army camp where we stopped and waited for the camper with our guides and fellow pillion riders to arrive. We felt relieved yet immensely satisfied to have experienced this incredible ride!

Once they arrived, we chatted for a while, enjoyed some food, and then set off towards Pangong Tso. The rest of the ride was peaceful, with pleasant curvy roads and only a few small sections in poor condition.

Pangong Tso is a much larger lake compared to Tso Moriri, as we drove alongside the lake for at least an hour before reaching our accommodation — [**The Royal Foster Cottage**](https://goo.gl/maps/o9W6VzFzvWDCDxvx8), in Lukung.

During our stay at Pangong Tso, we were treated to a breathtaking view of the lake right from our windows! 🔥 Some of us indulged in a long-awaited hot bath, as we hadn't had access to hot water for quite some time, and it felt incredibly soothing. We had a delightful dinner, filled with laughter and lively conversation before retiring for the night. Some ventured out to capture photos of the moon-less sky, as the moon had yet to rise above the mountains facing us. Later, they even experimented with light painting.

Another adventurous day came to an end, leaving us with wonderful memories!

### **🏍️** Day 13 - **Wed, Jun 07, 2023 : Pangong Tso ➡️ Hundar, Nubra**

We woke up the next morning to a pleasant surprise: Pangong had received some snow overnight. There was a light dusting of snow on the ground and the mountains in front of us were covered in a thick blanket of snow, a striking contrast to their snow-free appearance the day before.

After packing up and getting ready, we enjoyed a hearty breakfast before mounting our bikes and embarking on our journey to Nubra Valley.

The initial stretch of the road was in good condition, but after making a stop for refueling, we encountered a lot of off-road terrain, similar to what we experienced on our way to Tso Moriri. To add to the adventure, there was a light rain and a touch of snowfall.

Along the way, we came across the Himalayan Marmots and couldn't resist engaging with them for a while before continuing our ride. At one point, we encountered some thrilling cliff-side curvy roads that provided an exhilarating riding experience, although there were still some off-road sections in between.

During our journey, we took a break to enjoy an ATV ride. The non-riders among us were given the opportunity to ride the ATVs 😂 It was a bit different from our experiences in Bengaluru, where we were trained to ride the bikes independently. Here, we had a companion who sat along to assist in controlling the ATV in certain sections of the trail. Nonetheless, it was a fun experience 😂 After the ATV adventure, we took a break at a nearby cafe, refuelled ourselves, and then continued our journey towards Nubra.

We finally arrived at our accommodations in Hundar, Nubra — [**Paramount Camp**](https://goo.gl/maps/afBFHHKudD3zNYdeA). It was a cozy camp where we relaxed, enjoyed our dinners, and spent some time chatting with our guides. Some of our group members (not me 😂) engaged in lengthy conversations with the guides, continuing well into the midnight hours.

The day's ride was relatively straightforward, mostly consisting of off-road sections, leading us to Hundar. Compared to the previous day's thrilling adventure, this leg of the journey could be considered less adventurous 😂

### **🏍️** Day 14 - **Thu, Jun 08, 2023 : Hundar, Nubra ➡️ Khardung-La ➡️ Leh**

We woke up the next day and attended to our natural obligations 😂 before setting off on our journey back to Leh. Our route required us to conquer the mighty Khardung-La pass to reach our destination. As we made our way towards the check post, we encountered some very light snowfall, and we hoped that the weather conditions wouldn't worsen at the top. However, upon reaching the check post, we were informed that traffic from our direction was temporarily halted. We took this opportunity to enjoy some Chai ☕️ and light snacks while we waited, and we had a pleasant conversation with some elderly ladies from Karnataka, discussing their own trip experiences.

Eventually, we received news from the check post that we were allowed to proceed, so we eagerly mounted our bikes. Similar to our ride through Kaksang-La, we decided it would be safer for pillion riders to travel in the camper in case heavy snowfall occurred at the summit. Therefore, we waited for the camper to join us at the check post. Once everyone was together, the pillions boarded the camper, and we embarked on our journey towards the mighty Khardung-La.

The ride presented a mix of under-construction off-road sections and well-paved roads. Upon reaching the top, like everyone else, we couldn't resist stopping to capture some pictures and play in the snow before continuing our journey.

The remaining part of the trip was peaceful, and we had become more adept at handling the Himalayan bikes, riding with grace and speed, which added an extra element of fun to the otherwise straightforward ride.

We all rejoiced when we arrived at the other check post in Leh! 👏🏽 We were thrilled to have completed most of our planned itinerary despite the challenges we faced along the way.

Before heading to our accommodation in Leh — Khamba Villa, we made a stop at a restaurant owned by Chopa's friend - [Devine Cafe](https://goo.gl/maps/E7ugceHgnwRPq5ue7). There, we savored some delicious food, engaged in conversations, and our talented singers in the group serenaded us with their melodious voices. It was a memorable way to conclude our day before retiring to our accommodations.

Sachin, our mechanic, bid us farewell as he headed home, and we expressed our gratitude and wished him luck for his future adventures!

Back at our stay, we indulged in a game of UNO, enjoyed some snacks, beer, and Chang, a local alcoholic beverage of Ladakh made from Barley. We gathered around a bonfire, and our singers, along with Chopa and Padma, treated us to more soulful performances. We relaxed and enjoyed the lively atmosphere until midnight before finally retiring to our beds for a restful sleep.

### **🏍️** Day 15 - **Fri, Jun 09, 2023 : Sightseeing @ Leh**

We woke up later than usual the next day, as our plan for the day was to engage in some relaxed sightseeing and explore the Leh Market. Unlike previous days, we didn't need to wear our riding gear—jackets, pants, and boots—which made us feel light and unrestricted. The weather in Leh was warm, so we didn't experience much cold, but we still carried our jackets in the camper, just in case the temperature dropped.

Our first stop was the Sangam-Zanskar river confluence, where we took some pictures before proceeding to Magnetic Hill. Interestingly, none of us felt any peculiar magnetic force at the hill; our vehicles didn't exhibit any movement as some people have described. We couldn't figure out what the fuss was all about 😂

Next, we made our way to the Hall of Fame. Similar to our visit to the Kargil War Memorial on Day 7, this place evoked a mix of pride for our brave soldiers and sadness for those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our safety. As we read about the extreme conditions our soldiers endure, including memory loss experienced at the Siachen Peak, we were filled with admiration for their unwavering commitment to protect our nation. We salute our soldiers and all those who dedicate their lives to safeguarding our country.

Finally, we headed towards the Leh Market, as many of us desired to shop for souvenirs and gifts for our families. We enjoyed some local cuisine, strolled through the market, and immersed ourselves in the vibrant atmosphere until dusk. Eventually, we returned to our accommodations, some of us had dinner, and with heavy hearts, we prepared ourselves for the night, knowing that our journey had come to an end. 😟

### ✈️ Day 16 - **Sat, Jun 10, 2023** : LEH ➡️ BOM ➡️ BLR Flight

We woke up with a mix of emotions, packing our bags and having breakfast, knowing that our trip was coming to an end. Our hearts felt heavy, but our minds were already dreaming about the next adventure in Ladakh. Reluctantly, we made our way to the airport, preparing to board our flights. Some of us scrambled to rearrange our belongings, ensuring they met the weight restrictions 😂

Upon reaching Bombay, we faced the unfortunate news of a two-hour flight delay. However, eventually, we arrived in Bengaluru, and the first thing on our agenda was to savor a comforting cup of Filter Coffee. Finally, it was time to bid farewell to one another, each of us heading home for the night, carrying memories of our incredible journey in our hearts.

## 👋 Conclusion

In conclusion, our expedition through the awe-inspiring landscapes of Ladakh was a transformative journey that exceeded our expectations. From the moment we embarked on our adventure, we were captivated by the sheer beauty and grandeur of this Himalayan region. Throughout our trip, we rode through winding mountain passes, witnessed breathtaking vistas, and embraced the thrill of exploring uncharted territories. The snow-capped peaks, shimmering lakes, and vast open valleys left us in awe of nature's wonders. Beyond the scenic beauty, we immersed ourselves in the rich cultural tapestry of Ladakh. Interacting with the warm and hospitable locals, we gained insights into their way of life, traditions, and deep-rooted spirituality. Each encounter was a reminder of the interconnectedness of humanity and the power of cultural exchange.

Our journey was not without its challenges, as we navigated through varying terrains and encountered unpredictable weather. But it was through these trials that we discovered our own resilience, forged lifelong friendships, and created cherished memories that will forever hold a special place in our hearts. As we reluctantly bid farewell to Ladakh, we carry with us a profound sense of gratitude for the experiences we had and the personal growth we achieved. The beauty and serenity of this land touched our souls and awakened a deep appreciation for the natural wonders that surround us.

In addition to our profound appreciation for the natural wonders of Ladakh, it is essential to acknowledge the tremendous efforts made by the Border Roads Organization (BRO) in maintaining and constructing roads in these extreme altitudes. The BRO's dedication and perseverance have played a vital role in making our journey possible, ensuring safe passage through treacherous terrains and enabling us to witness the splendors of this region. Moreover, as we traversed through the rugged landscapes, we were constantly reminded of the unwavering commitment and bravery of the soldiers who stand guard over our nation's borders. These courageous men and women, selflessly protecting our sovereignty, deserve our utmost respect and gratitude. Their unwavering dedication and readiness to make the ultimate sacrifice serve as a constant reminder of the preciousness of our freedom and security. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the Border Roads Organization and the valiant soldiers who work tirelessly to keep our borders safe and accessible. Their extraordinary efforts allow travelers like us to embark on memorable journeys and experience the unparalleled beauty of Ladakh. We carry their spirit of resilience and selflessness with us as a source of inspiration and a reminder of the collective responsibility we share in upholding the values and safety of our nation.

The memories of our adventurous rides, the laughter shared around campfires, and the moments of quiet contemplation in the midst of pristine landscapes will forever inspire us. We return home with a renewed sense of wonder, a broader perspective on life, and a desire to continue exploring the world with open hearts and adventurous spirits. Ladakh has imprinted its indelible mark on our souls, and we depart with a promise to return one day to embrace its rugged beauty once again. Until then, we carry the spirit of Ladakh within us, a reminder to live with a sense of adventure, embrace the unknown, and cherish every moment of discovery.
