## Day 1: ‚úàÔ∏è Journey to Agatti Island and Our First Dive ü§ø

Our journey to the idyllic Agatti Island began early, with an exciting flight from Bengaluru to Kochi and another flight from Kochi, soon enough, we were off to Agatti, the only Lakshadweep island with an airport‚Äîand what an airport it is! The runway is so compact that it can hold just one flight at a time. Later, we learned from the team at Ammathi (the scuba dive shop on the island) that occasional issues can halt flights entirely, stranding tourists for days and depleting the island‚Äôs food supplies. Upon landing, Sameer from Ammathi Dive Shop welcomed us and drove us to our accommodation. The drive, though short, was magical: we were flanked by turquoise sea on both sides, with lush tropical foliage rising ahead of us on the island.

<b>About Agatti, Lakshadweep</b> - Agatti Island is a small but vibrant community with a population largely dependent on fishing, coconut farming, and tourism. While modern conveniences are limited, the people here exude warmth, rooted in the island‚Äôs simple, traditional way of life. What makes Agatti even more remarkable is its breathtaking lagoon on the western side, a serene stretch of crystal-clear water that sparkles under the sun. This lagoon is an ideal spot for snorkeling, diving, and soaking in the natural beauty that feels untouched by time.

After settling into our cozy accommodations, we couldn't resist the allure of the underwater world. Despite our initial plan to relax, we couldn't pass up the opportunity for a dive at a site called _Ujra Point_, just beyond the lagoon. As we submerged, we found ourselves in a mesmerizing underwater realm with visibility of 10-15 meters, an upgrade from what we were used to on the mainland. Schools of fish swam around us, and we encountered our first highlight: the Unicorn Fish‚Äîa beautifully odd creature we‚Äôd never seen before! But the true showstopper was a sea turtle, casually resting on the ocean floor. It was an unforgettable encounter that left us thrilled, already feeling that our trip was worth it.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, we retired for the night, our minds filled with images of the underwater wonders we had just witnessed. The excitement for the days to come was palpable, as we eagerly anticipated the diving adventures that awaited us.

## Day 2: ü§ø Diving at Bangaram & Thinakkara Islands üèùÔ∏è

The second day of our adventure took us further into the heart of Lakshadweep's underwater paradise. Our destination was the pristine waters near Bangaram and Thinakkara Islands‚Äî jewels known for their incredible marine biodiversity. We set off some time after dawn, with the faint silhouettes of these islands beckoning us from the horizon, eager to discover what lay beneath the surface.

Our first dive at Manta Point was nothing short of thrilling. We were immediately surrounded by vibrant schools of fish, moving in kaleidoscopic formations. The first highlight was an eagle ray nestled under a rocky outcrop, which glided away with graceful sweeps as we cautiously approached. Not long after, we spotted a nurse shark resting beneath another rock ledge. It stayed calm and unbothered, continuing to lounge as we watched in awe. We even glimpsed a sea turtle swimming effortlessly in the distance, adding to the dive‚Äôs sense of wonder.

Our second dive took us to Thinakkara Lighthouse, where the coral reefs were teeming with even more marine life. Colorful Lionfish, with their spiky fins fanned out like feathery crowns, hovered in the water, while Angelfish darted by in radiant hues, their patterns as vibrant as stained glass. Playful Clownfish peeked in and out of sea anemones, and the elegant Bannerfish swam in small groups, trailing their long dorsal fins like banners in the current. A stingray passed by in the distance, its movement slow and mesmerizing, and shortly after, a green turtle made a graceful appearance, completing an unforgettable day of diving.

With our dives complete by noon, we returned for a relaxing afternoon. After lunch, we unwound with some French cricket and frisbee on the sand, enjoying laughs and reliving the day's highlights. As the evening drew close, we felt deeply content and ready for whatever Day 3 would bring.

### **Day 3:** üåë **Evening & Night Dive at Agatti** ü§ø

For our third day, we had something thrilling lined up‚Äîour very first night dive! Both dives were planned around Agatti, and with the dive scheduled for the evening, we spent a relaxing morning exploring the island. We rented bicycles and took a leisurely 12-kilometer ride around Agatti. Pedaling along palm-lined paths, with the sea never far from view, it was the perfect way to soak in the island‚Äôs beauty and enjoy its laid-back atmosphere.

As evening approached, we headed to the Ammathi Dive Centre, excited and a little nervous for our first dive in the dark. After gearing up, we hopped onto the boat and set off toward a dive site just past Agatti‚Äôs lagoon. Our first dive, at a spot called Jack‚Äôs Point, did not disappoint. Amid schools of shimmering fish, we spotted familiar Bannerfish alongside Sweetlips and Grunts. Then, as if to make the experience unforgettable, the resident sea turtle glided up close to us, giving us an incredible, almost surreal view. Watching it float calmly by was mesmerizing‚Äîits graceful movements reminded us of our instructor‚Äôs serene buoyancy, moving effortlessly, just like the turtle.

Once back on the boat, we waited for nightfall, and our trip delivered yet another surprise‚Äîdolphins! At least 7 or 8 of them swam in the distance, arcing gracefully in and out of the water. We watched, captivated, as they moved with playful ease. Just when we thought this trip couldn‚Äôt get any better, there they were, adding a touch of magic to the evening.

With the sun finally setting, it was time for the night dive. We geared up once more and back-rolled into the water at Rocky Bottom, descending into the inky darkness. Diving at night was both eerie and calming; our torches cast narrow beams that cut through the blackness, revealing hidden treasures. We spotted crabs scuttling along the rocks, lobsters emerging from crevices, and various fish swimming around in the dark. It was surreal, as if we had entered a secret world reserved for nightfall. As we ascended, we turned off our torches for one final treat‚Äîbioluminescence. We splashed around, and tiny blue-green lights flickered around us, responding to our movements like stars in the water. It was mesmerizing, the perfect end to a day filled with unforgettable moments.

## Day 4: ü§ø Deep Diving at the Grand Canyon and a Night of Surprises ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Our fourth day was packed with incredible experiences, making it the most memorable of all. Today‚Äôs dives took us around the stunning Bangaram and Thinakkara Islands, but this time, Prajwal and I were putting our deep-diving certifications to the test. Our first dive was planned for the _Grand Canyon_‚Äîa dive site that drops to an impressive 40-45 meters, depending on the tide. We hit the water at high tide, so while we didn‚Äôt reach the very bottom, descending into the depths of Lakshadweep was an unforgettable thrill.

As we dove deeper, we crossed through thermoclines, where the temperature dropped from a warm 30¬∞C at the surface to a brisk 26¬∞C. By the time we reached 37.7 meters, the vast, dark drop-off stretched below us, giving an eerie yet captivating view. It was surreal, staring into the endless blue abyss, but we couldn‚Äôt linger long‚Äîour No Decompression Limit (NDL) allowed us only a few minutes at this depth. With one minute of NDL left, we started ascending, but the memory of that sight will stay with me forever. Returning to the shallower regions, we were once again welcomed by our trip‚Äôs mascot‚Äîthe peaceful sea turtle, gliding effortlessly through the water.

Our second dive was much more relaxed at a site called Shallow Point. Here, we enjoyed the colorful reef teeming with marine life: Clownfish nestled in anemones, Sweetlips, Grunts, and Bannerfish darting about. At a distance, we caught a glimpse of a Whitetip Reef Shark cruising in the deeper waters, adding an extra thrill to our dive. And, of course, the ever-present sea turtle made an appearance, as if to remind us it was still watching over our journey.

### Evening Cultural Festivities and a Heartwarming Surprise

Since our dives wrapped up by midday, we spent a relaxing afternoon at our stay. The folks at Ammathi Dive Centre had organized a special evening for us, showcasing Lakshadweep‚Äôs rich cultural heritage. We watched three traditional performances: **Parichakali**, **Kolkali**, and **Ulakkamuttu**. Parichakali featured dancers circling a light, performing with mock swords and shields, while Kolkali dancers used sticks to create a rhythmic beat. The final performance, Ulakkamuttu, was a unique display of agility. Performers rhythmically moved two thick poles, clapping them together and apart, as a dancer timed their steps to hop between them‚Äîa mesmerizing and skillful dance. They even invited us to join, making it a night full of laughter and new experiences.

But the surprises didn‚Äôt end there! As we wrapped up the evening, Lakshadweep had one last gift for us‚Äîa sea turtle had nested near the dive shop, and that night, her eggs hatched! Tiny baby turtles emerged, instinctively scrambling toward the sea. All of us divers gathered to help guide these precious little creatures safely to the water, and over the course of the night, we likely helped 30 to 40 of them begin their journey to the ocean.

The day ended with a profound sense of wonder and connection. From deep-diving the Grand Canyon to helping newborn turtles find their way to the sea, Day 4 was an experience none of us would ever forget.

### **Day 5: Our Final Dive Day** ü§ø

Our last day of diving arrived all too soon, and the team at Ammathi planned a relaxed yet enchanting day for us around Agatti. Both dives, like the previous ones, were nothing short of magical. And, as if to send us off in style, our mascot‚Äîthe ever-faithful sea turtle‚Äîgraced us with its presence on both dives, bringing a familiar joy to the group.

On the first dive, I had a special moment spotting an octopus tucked away, expertly camouflaged in a crevice between rocks‚Äîa sneaky sight that, unfortunately, I alone caught. I also had the privilege of witnessing an unusual partnership in the underwater world: the Goby Fish and Pistol Shrimp. Watching these two completely different species work together for protection was like witnessing a tiny marvel of nature. We encountered a few moray eels as well, with their mouths slightly open, showing off in a stance that seemed to say, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come too close!‚Äù

Our second dive was filled with rays‚Äîan unforgettable experience. We came across two large stingrays nestled in the sand, their bodies half-buried and blending into the ocean floor. They quickly glided away as we drew closer, but we soon found a tiny stingray lying hidden under the sand, sound asleep and unbothered by our presence. The baby ray stayed perfectly still as we watched, offering a sweet, peaceful moment that felt like the perfect ending to our underwater adventure. Among the highlights, I spotted an octopus once again‚Äîthis time, I and three other divers were lucky enough to catch a glimpse of it in its vibrant colors. The excitement didn‚Äôt end there; I also got to see the Goby Fish and Pistol Shrimp duo again, a delightful reminder of the unique bond between these two species as they scuttled about, always looking out for one another. With the last dive wrapping up, we took time to capture photos of ourselves underwater in the dive gear, commemorating every amazing memory we had made over the past few days. With heavy hearts, we surfaced and climbed back onto the boat, knowing our final dive had come to an end.

The folks at Ammathi were kind enough to organize a snorkeling session at night for us today‚Äîan experience that turned out to be even more magical at night. As we hopped on the boat for the ride, we were greeted by a breathtaking night sky, unmarred by light pollution, allowing us to gaze at countless stars twinkling above us. Once we reached our snorkeling spot, we slipped into the water and were delighted to encounter various fish darting around us, along with a few curious shrimps making their presence known. The tranquility of the night water combined with the shimmering stars above made for an unforgettable experience.

However, we still had another full day on the island to enjoy! Back at our stay, we settled in and relished the evening, looking forward to making the most of our time in this tropical paradise before we had to leave. As the sun set over the Lakshadweep horizon, we took a moment to reflect on all the incredible memories we had created‚Äîthe beauty, the thrill, and the unexpected moments that made our adventure truly unforgettable.

After an incredible week of diving, we reached our final day in Agatti, which we had to dedicate to relaxation and exploration. Diving involves absorbing nitrogen under pressure, and flying too soon afterward can lead to decompression sickness, a condition caused by nitrogen bubbles forming in the body. Understanding the need for caution, we embraced this no-fly day as an opportunity to unwind and soak in the last moments of our adventure.

We spent the morning at our stay, reminiscing about the trip, playing frisbee, and wandering around the island. Conversations with the amazing folks at Ammathi provided us with rich insights into the history of the dive center and the unique culture of Lakshadweep.

As if anticipating our need for one last treat, the wonderful staff at Ammathi organized a boat ride to a small island next to Agatti, named **Kalpatti**. The short ride was a delight, and upon reaching the island, we explored its beauty, snapping plenty of photos along the way. The highlight was undoubtedly the breathtaking sunset we witnessed‚Äîone of the most stunning we had ever seen. It felt like the perfect punctuation mark on our trip, leaving us with a memory we would cherish forever.

After our return, we spent a bit more time with the Ammathi team, capturing final photos for our scrapbook of memories. With heavy hearts, we retired to our stay for the night, reflecting on the unforgettable experiences and friendships forged during our time in this beautiful paradise.

## Day 7 - Back to Bengaluru ‚úàÔ∏è

The day had come for us to return to Bengaluru. With heavy hearts, we packed our bags, knowing that our incredible journey was drawing to a close. After exchanging heartfelt goodbyes with Sameer and the wonderful team at Ammathi, we made our way to the airport. As we left Lakshadweep behind, a sense of longing lingered within us, igniting an itch to return to this beautiful paradise once again‚Äîhopefully, it wouldn't be long before we could dive back into those crystal-clear waters and create more unforgettable memories.

## Conclusion

Our diving expedition to Lakshadweep has been nothing short of magical. Each day brought new adventures, from exploring vibrant coral reefs and encountering mesmerizing marine life to sharing laughs and stories with friends. The stunning beauty of Agatti Island, with its serene lagoons and breathtaking sunsets, has left an indelible mark on our hearts.

The thrill of our first dives, the excitement of night explorations, and the joy of cultural experiences enriched our journey in ways we could never have imagined. As we reflected on our time spent together, we realized that this trip was about more than just diving; it was about the bonds we strengthened, the memories we created, and the beauty of nature that we had the privilege to witness.

A heartfelt thank you to the entire Ammathi Diving team for their unwavering support, guidance, and enthusiasm. Their expertise and passion for diving transformed our experience into something extraordinary. We look forward to returning to Lakshadweep and diving into more adventures in the future!
